Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this template provides a solid foundation for creating a functional and extensible Discord bot.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up and start using this Discord bot template.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.11.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually installed with Node.js)

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Yarondr/discord-bot-template.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

Now that you have the bot template installed, you can start building your own Discord bot.

1. Create a new bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain your bot token.

2. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file and create a new file named `.env` with the copied contents.

3. In the newly created `.env` file, fill in the following values:
    
   ```env
   BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
   TEST_SERVER_ID=YOUR_TEST_SERVER_ID
   OWNER_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID
   ```

   Make sure to replace the placeholders with your specific information.

5. Define your bot's commands, event handlers, and other functionality in the `src/slashCommands/` and `src/events/` directories.

6. Utilize buttons and modals by referring to the provided examples in the `src/interactions/` directory.

7. Start the bot by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your bot is now running and ready to interact with users using buttons and modals on your Discord server.
